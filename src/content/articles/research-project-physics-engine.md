title: Research Project Physics Engine
description: In South Australia, students must use their creativity and initiative, while developing the research and presentation skill to complete a research project (RP) in either of their final two years of schooling. For my project, I decided to research how to implement a 2D physics engine in JavaScript and presented it in my outcome as a website with multiple examples demonstrating how it works.

In South Australia, students must use their creativity and initiative, while developing the research and presentation skill to complete a research project (RP) in either of their final two years of schooling. For my project, I decided to research how to implement a 2D physics engine in JavaScript and presented it in my outcome as a website with multiple examples demonstrating how it works.

For this work I achieved an A+.
