StimUI, an short for "Stimulus User Interface" is a JavaScript library providing a set of reusable, accessible components built on top of StimulusJS. The goal is to provide a library of headless UI controllers as the smallest necessary set of composable UI primitives following the accessibility guidlines and terminology from the ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG).
